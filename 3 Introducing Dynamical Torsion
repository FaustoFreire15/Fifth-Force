        3.1    Theoretical Rationale
In the Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble (ECSK) framework, torsion arises algebraically from spin density. However, this formulation severely limits its physical relevance: torsion cannot propagate, cannot exist in a vacuum, and lacks a true field equation. These constraints render torsion a mere localized response, not an independent field—unlike electromagnetism or gravity.
In my approach, I reinterpret torsion as the first spacetime projection of Πώ—a pre-geometric field that precedes all geometric structures. Torsion is no longer a passive consequence of spin but becomes a dynamic entity in its own right. To elevate spin to the status of a fundamental interaction—a fifth force—we must endow torsion with dynamics, much as Maxwell endowed electromagnetism with its own field equations.
3.2    Modifying the Action
To this end, I propose an extended action that includes a kinetic term for torsion, analogous to Yang–Mills theory:

Where:
    •  is the Ricci scalar constructed from the full affine connection (which includes torsion),
    •  is the kinetic term for the torsion field,
    • An optional mass term  can be included to account for short-range behavior.
This formulation allows torsion to propagate even in the absence of matter, turning it into a dynamical field analogous to gauge bosons.
        3.3    Field Equations from Variation
Variation of the action with respect to the metric  yields the modified Einstein field equations:

where  represents the stress-energy contribution from the torsion field.
Variation with respect to the torsion tensor  produces a genuine torsion wave equation:

This result parallels the Proca equation for a massive vector field and opens the door for torsion waves in vacuum—a fundamental departure from classical ECSK theory.

Summary of Innovations
This chapter marks a critical shift: spin is no longer treated as a static quantum number but as an active field, and torsion becomes its physical manifestation. By introducing a kinetic term, torsion evolves from a localized artifact into a propagating field, thereby reframing gravity as a secondary effect—a derivative of deeper spin-torsion dynamics. This redefinition not only enhances the theoretical landscape but also opens new avenues for experimental detection and theoretical integration with quantum gravity models.
