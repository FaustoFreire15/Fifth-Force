In this paper, I introduce Πώ (Πρωταρχική ώθηση, Primordial Impulse)—pronounced “promega,” a pre-geometric field hypothesized to underlie both spin and quantum entanglement. Within this framework, spin is redefined—not merely as a quantum number, but as the primary observable manifestation of Πώ, with quantum entanglement arising from its inherent coherence conserved across systems. By advancing a modified Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble (ECSK) theory, torsion is recast as a dynamic field driven by spin, leading to the emergence of gravity as a secondary phenomenon. Extending the Dirac equation to integrate independent torsion dynamics elevates spin to the status of a fifth fundamental force. The theoretical predictions encompass experimental signatures such as phase anomalies in quantum entanglement, modifications in gravitational wave polarization patterns, and detectable torsion effects in spinor systems. Ultimately, this approach reinterprets space, time, and nonlocal phenomena as emergent from the timeless, geometry-independent coherence of Πώ.
