Corrected and Enhanced Foreword:
This work presents a fundamental shift in theoretical physics by reinterpreting spin as more than just a secondary quantum property; rather, it proposes spin as a fundamental interaction, potentially representing a fifth natural force. Within the modified Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble (ECSK) theoretical framework, I introduce independent dynamics for spacetime torsion. Here, torsion is driven not only by the spin density of matter but by an underlying Primordial Force (Πώ), existing independently of and preceding spacetime itself. Moving beyond traditional theoretical physics, this concept engages deeply with philosophical questions, inspiring the term “Philosophysic.”
This novel approach enables torsion waves to propagate independently of fermionic matter, positioning spin as an essential precursor to both torsion and curvature. The theoretical extensions explored include modifications to Einstein’s field equations, an enhanced Dirac equation, and a gauge-like formulation of torsion dynamics comparable to Yang–Mills theory.
To substantiate this hypothesis, experimental avenues in quantum and astrophysical domains are proposed, notably high-precision torsion balance experiments, analyses of gravitational wave polarization, and quantum entanglement investigations. This reconceptualization provides potential insights relevant to Loop Quantum Gravity, supersymmetric theories, and quantum cosmology, thus paving a novel route toward unifying quantum mechanics and gravity.
An accessible metaphor is drawn between Πώ and Earth’s climate, likening deep oceanic currents to the hidden coherence underlying spin, suggesting a subtle yet profound influence analogous to climate dynamics shaped by oceanic vortices.
