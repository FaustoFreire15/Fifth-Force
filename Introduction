Introduction

For the past century, physics has faced a fundamental impasse, reminiscent of two tunnel-boring teams attempting to connect through a massive mountain from opposite sides. Despite precise calculations and confident progress, the tunnels remain disconnected. This situation mirrors the unresolved incompatibility between the vast, deterministic domain of general relativity (GR), governing large-scale cosmic phenomena, and the probabilistic, discrete world described by quantum mechanics (QM), focused on the microscopic scale.
This discord has presented physicists with limited possibilities: either GR or QM could be incorrect, both could be incorrect, or each may represent partial truths awaiting reconciliation. This latter perspective forms the foundation of this research.
Quantum entanglement vividly illustrates the depth of the divide between classical and quantum theories. It defies conventional notions of space and time, demonstrating that two entangled particles maintain interconnected states despite vast distances. Experimental validations, notably by Alain Aspect in the 1980s, have affirmed that quantum predictions align with reality in ways classical physics cannot adequately explain.
This phenomenon prompts profound reconsiderations of spacetime and causality. While general relativity models spacetime as a smooth continuum, quantum mechanics suggests deeper, nonlocal connections beyond conventional geometric interpretations. Researchers increasingly propose speculative yet intriguing ideas—ranging from hidden variables to emergent spacetime—that challenge our traditional understanding of physical reality.
Central to my approach is a fundamental revision of spin's role. Rather than viewing spin as merely a quantum attribute, I propose it as an underlying interaction preceding spacetime curvature, mediated by a Promega (Πώ—Primordial Force). Spin thus becomes an essential, dynamic field shaping the geometry of the universe via torsion, with gravity emerging subsequently from spin-torsion dynamics. This concept invites a deeper exploration of the universe, redefining our understanding of both fundamental physics and the very nature of reality itself.
