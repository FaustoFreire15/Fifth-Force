In the Einstein–Cartan theory, the full affine connection  includes torsion and therefore deviates from the symmetric Levi-Civita connection . This deviation is captured by the contorsion tensor , defined by:

The contorsion tensor itself relates to the torsion tensor TμνλT^\lambda_{\mu\nu} through:

Torsion is antisymmetric in its lower indices:

        4.2    From Action to Torsion Field Equation
This is where the geometry becomes dynamic. By introducing a Lagrangian with a kinetic term for torsion, I allow torsion to propagate and behave as a genuine field, rather than a constraint imposed by matter spin.
The torsion-spin interaction term for spinor fields is:

Varying the full action with respect to the torsion field yields the torsion wave equation:

Here:
    •  is the axial projection of the torsion tensor,
    •  is the spin density current,
    •  is an optional mass parameter (zero in the massless case),
    •  is the covariant derivative.
When , this becomes a wave equation for a massless field, similar to Maxwell’s equations.

Key Insight: Just as the electromagnetic field arises from local U(1) symmetry, torsion naturally arises when enforcing local Lorentz invariance on spinor fields in curved space.

        4.5    Preparing the Ground for Spin as a Force Field
The dynamical torsion derived above now serves as the field strength of an independent spin interaction—just as  serves for electromagnetism. The next logical step is to define:
    • A spin field strength tensor ,
    • A modified Dirac equation coupling to the spin field,
    • Divergence and curl-type relations analogous to Maxwell’s equations.
This elevates spin from an internal quantum label to a full-fledged interaction, capable of shaping geometry and matter dynamics—independent of curvature or energy-momentum.
Spin, in this formulation, becomes the signature of Πώ, encoded in the twist of spacetime itself.
